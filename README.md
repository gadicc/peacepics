## Contributing

The site is written in [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/).  To set up a
development environment from scratch, with the source to this project:

```bash
wget
git clone
cd peacepics
mrt update
meteor
```

and connect to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

***PLEASE ONLY SUBMIT PULL REQUESTS ON THE DEVEL BRANCH***

If the site catches on I'll continue to add more exciting features as time
allows (maybe some fun Famous animations, interesting statistics, etc.)
